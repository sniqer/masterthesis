 \S  \ This Master thesis involves developing a lightweight analyser that produce statistics from the communication link between a cell phone and a E-UTRAN base station. The analyser tool will produce graphs with information about the correlation between two signal data in the channel that the data is sent through (e.g throughput over interference). From the statistics produced by the analyser tool, the testing personell at Ericsson can more easily deduce where the interference in signals arises from and also make relevant analyses between UE\^a\GenericError  {(inputenc)                }{Package inputenc Error: Keyboard character used is undefined\MessageBreak in inputencoding `latin1'}{See the inputenc package documentation for explanation.}{You need to provide a definition with \DeclareInputText \MessageBreak or \DeclareInputMath before using this key.}\GenericError  {(inputenc)                }{Package inputenc Error: Keyboard character used is undefined\MessageBreak in inputencoding `latin1'}{See the inputenc package documentation for explanation.}{You need to provide a definition with \DeclareInputText \MessageBreak or \DeclareInputMath before using this key.}s.
