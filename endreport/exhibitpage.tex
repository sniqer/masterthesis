 \S  \ This master thesis involves developing a lightweight analyser that produce statistics from the traffic data in the communication link between a UE e.g. a cell phone and a E-UTRAN base station (the air interface). The analyser tool will produce graphs with information about the correlation between two signal data in the channel (e.g throughput over interference). From the statistics produced by the analysis tool, the testing personell at Ericsson can more easily detect potential faulty behavior from the UE or eNodeB in a much faster way than they were able to do before. This tool will also be able to help ericsson to rewrite test cases to be more indepth than they are now. To show that that it is possible to some kind of analysis with this tool, we made our own analysis on the link adaptation target BLER, this way we could validate that our tool could handle large amount of data and also that you can compare different data with each other. To be able to show that our tool is usable for Ericsson IODT we offered IODT test engineers to do tests on Link adaptation and HARQ with our tool and evaluate it with their current methods.
